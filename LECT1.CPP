What is a Programming Language:
A programming language is a formal language used to communicate instructions to a computer, allowing humans to write programs that can be executed by the machine.

Why Learn C++ instead of other Programming languages:
C++ offers a balance of low-level and high-level features, making it powerful for system/software development, game programming, and applications requiring performance and efficiency.

What is an IDE:
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software suite that provides comprehensive facilities to programmers for software development, including a code editor, compiler, debugger, and other tools.

What are High level and Low level languages:
High-level languages are closer to human languages and easier to code (e.g., Python, Java), while low-level languages are closer to machine code, offering more control over hardware (e.g., Assembly, C).

What happens after we write code:
After writing code, it is typically compiled or interpreted to convert it into machine language, which the computer can execute to perform the desired tasks.

What is a compiler:
A compiler is a program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code, bytecode, or another programming language.
